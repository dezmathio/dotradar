dotradar
========

Essentially a weather push notification service
that detects the weather over your location every ~15 minutes
and notifies you if there is rain/will be rain in the next 15 minutes.

Plans down the road:

Map an itinerary using Google. 
Cross check the path points with the current
radar data and percentages, and then predict locations
where you might encounter rain or adverse conditions on your itinerary

Good API to use
